## Footer Design Patterns

### Organizational Structure

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Content hidden behind tabs to reduce visual clutter
- **Consistent Iconography**: External links consistently marked with icons
- **Contact Integration**: Phone numbers embedded directly in link text
- **Dual-purpose Links**: Some items have both web links and phone numbers

### Content Categories

- **Self-Service**: Help Hub, password changes, personal info updates
- **Human Support**: Phone numbers and chat options prominently displayed
- **Reporting**: Dedicated section for safety and travel issues
- **Corporate**: Social media, legal notices, branding

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Tab Headers**: Clear section identification
- **External Link Icons**: Visual cue for links leaving the portal
- **Phone Number Formatting**: Consistent "| PHONE |" pattern
- **Social Media Grid**: Horizontal layout with branded icons

## Key Observations for Redesign

### Navigation Structure

1. **Complex Hierarchy**: Clear three-level hierarchy (Main > Section > Items) with some dropdowns containing 30+ items
2. **External Integration**: Heavy reliance on external systems (ServiceNow, identity management, third-party tools)
3. **Contact Information**: Phone numbers and help desk info integrated throughout both header and footer
4. **Multi-column Layouts**: Larger dropdowns use multi-column organization for better space utilization

### Content Patterns

5. **Mixed Content Types**: Combination of tools, information, policies, and external applications
6. **User Context**: Personalized elements (weather, user name, notifications) in header
7. **Help-First Design**: Footer prioritizes support and help functions
8. **Accessibility**: Clear labeling and consistent structure throughout

### Technical Implementation

9. **JavaScript-Heavy**: All main navigation items use "#" as href with JavaScript handling
10. **Icon Consistency**: External links clearly marked with icons throughout
11. **Responsive Considerations**: Complex dropdowns may need mobile-specific treatment
12. **Search Integration**: Site-wide search functionality integrated into main navigation

### User Experience

13. **Progressive Disclosure**: Footer tabs hide complexity while maintaining access
14. **Multiple Contact Methods**: Various ways to get help (web, phone, chat, email)
15. **Task-Oriented Organization**: Content grouped by user intent rather than organizational structure
16. **Consistent Branding**: United branding elements throughout (logo, colors, typography)

## Technical Notes

- All main navigation items use "#" as href with JavaScript handling
- External links clearly marked with icons using consistent iconography
- Consistent close buttons on all dropdowns
- Search functionality integrated into main navigation bar
- Responsive design considerations evident in layout structure
- Footer uses tablist ARIA pattern for accessibility
- Social media links use descriptive alt text and proper labeling
